Thanks!

## NOTE

The master branch will always contain the latest stable version. If you wish
to check older versions or newer ones currently under development, please
switch to the relevant branch/tag.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

To use this component, you need at least:

* [Composer][:composer:]
* PHP >= 5.4
* Latest stable [Phalcon Framework release][:phalcon:] extension enabled

### Installing

Install composer in a common location or in your project:

```sh
$ curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Create the composer.json file as follows:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "phalcongelist/breadcrumbs": "dev-master"
    }
}
```

Run the composer installer:

```sh
$ php composer.phar install
```

### Define your breadcrumbs

We recommend registering it with your application's services for even easier use:

```php
use Phalcon\Breadcrumbs;

// Initialize the Breadcrumbs component.
$di->setShared('breadcrumbs', function () {
    return new Breadcrumbs;
});
```

Adding a crumb with a link:

```php
$this->breadcrumbs->add(
    'Home',
    $this->router->getRouteByName('home')->getCompiledPattern()
);

```

Adding a crumb without a link (normally the last one):

```php
$this->breadcrumbs->add('User', null, ['linked' => false]);
```

Output crumbs:

```php
// Php Engine
<ol class="breadcrumb">
    <?php $this->breadcrumbs->output() ?>
</ol>
```

```volt
// Volt Engine
<ol class="breadcrumb">
  {{ breadcrumbs.output() }}
</ol>
```

Change crumb separator:

```php
$this->breadcrumbs->setSeparator(' &raquo; ');
```
